     Assignment 2

Exercises from "Approximation Theory and Approximation Practice"

Due at 10pm on Thursday 6th January. You submit the homework by sending an email to Max Helgren (meh249@cornell.edu) with a PDF attached. Make the subject of the email: "MATH6220, <your name>: HW1". 

6.2, 6.4, 7.1, 7.2, 7.5, 8.4, 8.9, 8.12

I suspect this should take you 1 or 2 hours, not much more. Some of the other exercises are very useful and you may like to read and think about them.
