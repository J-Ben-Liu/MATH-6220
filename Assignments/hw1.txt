     Assignment 1

Exercises from "Approximation Theory and Approximation Practice"

Due at 10pm on Thursday 30th January. You submit the homework by sending an email to Max Helgren (meh249@cornell.edu) with a PDF attached. Make the subject of the email: "MATH6220, <your name>: HW1". 

1.1, 2.2, 2.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.10, 3.16, 4.7 

I suspect this should take you 1 or 2 hours, not much more. Some of the other exercises are very useful and you may like to read and think about them.
